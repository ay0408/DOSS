# Direction-Oriented Smooth Sensitivity

## Future Directions

・Investigating $(\alpha, \beta)$-admissible distributions on $m$-dimensional space, especially when $m$ is large.

・Developing more efficient methods for computing direction-oriented local sensitivity and smooth sensitivity.

## Note

For details of our methods and discussion, please see our paper entitled "Direction-Oriented Smooth Sensitivity and Its Application to Genomic Statistical Analysis".
